## Hello world!
This is my first post so I want to only say hello! Purpose of this blog is to keep track of my blockchain (and probably different technologies) new-gained-skills.

### About me - job
More world about me: currently I work in Future Processing, polish IT company. I'm blockchain developer (or more precisely: trying to be). Previously I was senior Java developer.

Now I'm trying to know better Ethereum world. I already created simply footprint storage. Smart contract is written in Solidity, I've chosen Hardhat framework.

My second Ethereum-related task was to bring bac to live our internal betting application. This is easy to use platform to bet match results during World Cup 2022!

### Personal projects
Out of my company time I'm learning Rust, Solana and Polkadot.
